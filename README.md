This repository contains the last version of the fire model that was developed during the SandBox course (all the classes are located inside the src folder).
Comments explaining the model components and the logic behind their methods can be found in all the major statements and functions of the code.

A short R script that performs a scaling procedure so as to map SandBox measurements (time, speed, and distance traveled by the flame particles) to real measurements is also included.

This project was developed by :
<ul>
  <li>Christian</li>
  <li>Diego Morales</li>
  <li>Aws Dib</li>
  <li>Mónica Magán</li>
</ul>

To use this version please replace the old source folder by the one that is stored in this repository.

If you have further questions please do not hesitate to contact me.
